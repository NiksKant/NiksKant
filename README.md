<h1>👋 Hi there! I'm Nikhil Kant</h1>
  <p>
    I'm an aspiring web developer passionate about building clean, functional, and user-friendly web applications.
  </p>

  <h2>🌱 Learning Journey</h2>
  <p>
    I’m currently on an exciting journey of learning <strong>Web Development</strong>, diving deep into <strong>HTML</strong>, <strong>CSS</strong>, <strong>JavaScript</strong>, and gradually exploring modern frameworks like <strong>React</strong> and <strong>Node.js</strong>. My goal is to understand how the web works and contribute to meaningful projects that solve real-world problems.

  </p>

  <h2>📁 Projects & Progress</h2>
